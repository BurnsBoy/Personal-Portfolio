                Starting in January of 2019. I had a plan to create an open world sci-fi adventure. I was well aware that the project was 
            far too ambitious for someone with very little game design experience to complete, but I didn't care. Working on this project helped 
            me learn so much about game development, It might be far from complete, but it served as an amazing learning tool for myself.</p>

                In January of 2020, I was satisfied with my work on Moons of the Aether, I sought out to participate in my first game jam
                <em>Weekly Game Jams</em> was hosting a week long game jam in February, so I decided to take part! The theme was "magnets" so I 
                created an endless runner with a jet that would be pushed or pulled by different magnetic obstacles. It wasn't the best game, but 
                it gave me an idea of what to expect from game jams going forward.</p>

                Later in February of 2020, <em>Brackeys</em> was hosting a week long game jam. I really dropped the ball on this one, I didn't 
                give myself enough time to work on it and I got stuck trying to create an A.I. that simply would not work. Terrible game, although
                it really taught me that if I want to make something good, I have to put in more time and effort.</p>

                In July of 2020, <em>GMTK</em> hosted a 48 hour game jam. I made sure I had work off during that time and devoted myself to it. 
                The game itself didn't turn out half bad, but I didn't participate in the community very much, so not many people rated my game. 
                It didn't perform too well in the game jam because of that.</p>

                In August of 2020, <em>Brackeys</em> hosted another week long game jam. I was ready, I took what I learned from past mistakes and 
                I made a time bending puzzle game that the other participants loved! It performed very well, I recieved a lot of positive feedback
                and it has to be my favorite entry to any game jam so far!</p>

                <em>Weekly Game Jams</em> was hosting a game jam in October of 2020 with a $100 cash prize for the winner. I decided to join. I 
                was proud of the UI and effects, but only got one rating because it was such a small event in comparison to the other game jams I 
                participated in.</p>

                Project Slap was a personal project I used to teach myself more about Unity. I started working on it in November of 2020 and my last
                update was in May of 2021. It was essentially a smaller scope Moons of the Aether. I played around a lot with animations and velocities.</p>

                <em>Brackeys</em> was hosting another game jam in February of 2021. I took a whole week off work to devote myself to it. I really enjoyed 
                my time working on it, I was proud of what I was creating, but had to rush the level design on the last night. It performed very well
                in the game jam!</p>

                <em>GMTK</em> hosted a 48 hour game jam in June of 2021. I was determined that I would my entry would be better than last year's GMTK game jam.
                I was proud of what I accomplished in that 48 hours, I recieve a lot of positive comments, but it didn't perform as well as some of my other entries.

                I started working on a room building roguelike in July of 2021. I learned a lot about generating random platforms and enemy A.I. systems. This is 
                my most fleshed out project that isn't a game jam.</p>

                <em>Github</em> hosted a month long game jam in November of 2021. I had a lot of time to work on this project. It uses a mix of first
                and third person views with a bug that can climb walls and sneak through cracks. This entry would have performed extremely well, but it 
                didn't have enough ratings so it was penalized. I really enjoyed working on this project and I'm very proud of it.</p>

                <em>Trijam</em> hosted 3 hour long game jam in December of 2021. It seemed like such an interesting concept, I had to give it a shot. It was interesting to 
            say the least. My entry didn't perform very well, but I enjoyed the experience nevertheless.</p>

                <em>Brackeys</em> had a game jam in February of 2022. My focus was on character movement and sound. I really liked how this entry turned out, 
                but many people didn't like the graphics and the over use of purple.

                I originally had no intention in participating in the <em>GMTK</em> game jam in July of 2022, but the theme was "roll of the dice"
                And I had an Idea for a very simple game that only took me 5 hours to create. I eventually fleshed it out and made it a mobile game 
                called <em>Matching Pips</em>.

                My most recent game jam entry was for <em>Brackeys</em> in August of 2022. My main focus was on the environment and graphics which 
                I feel turned out pretty great. It was well recieved, although not as well as some of my other entries.
