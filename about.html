                Growing up, I've always loved playing video games. Aside from being an astronaut, 
                a video game developer was my dream job as a kid.</p>

                It was around my junior year of high school I decided I wanted to get into film-making. 
                I took a class on screenwriting and film broadcasting and I was convinced it was something I wanted to do.
                It wasn't until my senior year of high school when I first took a programming class. I had a natural talent for
                it but my heart was still set on film-making.</p>

        In 2014, I was accepted into <em>Eastern Michigan University</em> to study <em>Electronic Media and Film Theory</em> 
        with a minor in 
        <em>Computer Science</em>. As my enrollment continued, I found myself enjoying the computer science courses much more than 
        the film theory classes, I decided to change my major to <em>Simulation, Animation, and Gaming</em>.</p>

            <p>
            The courses I took revolved around 3d design, learning to use different software programs, and coding. I started dating 
            my who 
            would later become my wife. I participated in the marching band playing the trombone. I also got my first job in food 
            service while on campus.</p>

            In 2019, I spent my last semester at EMU commuting to school twice a week. I began practicing game design in Unity and 
            I started working at <em>Taco Bell</em>. After graduating college I would spend much of my free time learning
            to develop games in Unity using the skills I learned in college as well as teaching myself new skills.</p>

            <p>
            Since then, I've gotten married, I've participated in 12 game jams and worked on several personal Unity projects. I've become a manager at Taco Bell,
            and I had a son in May of 2022.</p>

        With all of my experience using Unity, I've come to the conclusion that coding is my favorite aspect of game design. 
        I joined <em>Coding Temple</em> in January of 2023 with the hopes of learning new programming skills and a start to my 
        career as a software developer!</p>
